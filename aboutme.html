              <p class="card-text"> Hi, I am Hayley Gold and I am 17 years old in Marlboro High School. I have always had a passion for coding and web design. As I have currently been going on the journey through the Web Design Pathway Program here
                at Marlboro High School, I have been amazed and fascinated. I have discovered my new love and passion for coding and led me to realize that this is something I would want to carry on for my future. I have always had a love for
                technology even since I was younger and have always found it fascinating to me. Learn more about me and my journey below :)</p>

                  <p>Ever since I was little, I was always attached to the factors of technology. Whether it was from setting up my iPhone, to observing websites, to debugging a wifi problem in the house, it always fascinated me. However, it was not
                    until later where I discovered my love for coding and having the ability to make a website that are similar to ones we use on the daily. I would never have thought that I would be capable to learn the skills and languages to
                    create such websites, but I was wrong. The Web Design Program has greatly helped me with programming and has set me up for success for my future. Every new language and skill we learn is a new step towards advancing in the web
                    design process.</p>

              <div class="card-body">
                <p>During the past year, I have started learning the basics of code such as a couple languages like HTML and CSS. I have learned how to work with both of these languages together and program a functioning websites. We learned about
                  the basic tags and functions of code including attributes, pseudo-classes, etc. Moving further throughout last year I was able to get into the language of Bootstrap, giving myself the opportunity to be more creative and have an
                  easier coding experience. Using these three languages together have helped me to create the most fascinating websites. Over my sophomore year, I was amazed at myself and what I was capable of doing and I am excited to see what this
                  year brings for me through the second year of the program. I never would of thought that an individual like myself would be able to create such websites but it was all from the skills I have learned along the journey. Through the
                  third year of the program, I am currently starting to get into the Javascript language, further enhancing my programming skills. </p>
